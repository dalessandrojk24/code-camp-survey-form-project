# Random Survey Project

## Overview
The Random Survey project is a simple HTML-based survey designed to collect fun and random data from users. It consists of several sections with diverse input types to make the experience interactive and engaging. This project is currently static, and the submit functionality will be added as I learn more about coding and develop my skills further.

## Features

### Section 1: Basic Information
- Users are prompted to provide their **email**, **name**, and a **random number** between 1 and 100.

### Section 2: Animal Personality
- A dropdown menu allows users to select an animal that best represents their personality.

### Section 3: Drink Choice
- Radio buttons present a list of drinks from which users can select only one option.

### Section 4: Snack Preferences
- Checkboxes enable users to select multiple snack options that they enjoy.

### Section 5: Cheesy Pickup Line
- A text area provides space for users to type their cheesiest pickup line.

### Section 6: Survey Feedback
- A question asks users whether they enjoyed the survey, with options to choose from.

### Submit Button
- A submit button is included to allow users to submit their responses. Currently, this does not perform any action, but functionality will be added in future updates.

## Future Plans
- Add functionality to handle form submissions and store user responses.
- Improve styling and layout for a better user experience.
- Validate inputs to ensure data accuracy.
- Integrate backend technologies to process and save survey responses.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: To structure the survey.
- **CSS**: To style and enhance the visual presentation.
- **JavaScript** (future): To add interactivity and handle submissions.
